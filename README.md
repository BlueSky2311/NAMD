This code is designed to run molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics) software. It automates the process of running equilibration and production simulations for multiple systems, handling various scenarios such as initial runs, restarting from a previous simulation, and modifying input files as needed.

**Prerequisites**

Before running this code, make sure you have the following:

- Google Colab or a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed (pandas, os, shutil, subprocess, fileinput)
- A CSV file containing a list of job IDs for the systems you want to simulate (e.g., test.csv)
- CHARMM-GUI files for each system, which will be downloaded and extracted automatically
- NAMD software downloaded and extracted (the code will download version 3.0b6 if not available)

**Notes**
- The code assumes that the necessary input files (step4_equilibration.inp, step5_production.inp) are present in the namd folder for each simulation.
- The code is designed to run on Google Colab, but it can be adapted to run in other Python environments with the required libraries.
- Make sure to update the CSV file (test.csv) with the job IDs for the systems you want to simulate.
- The code automatically downloads and installs NAMD version 3.0b6. If you want to use a different version, you'll need to modify the corresponding lines.
Feel free to modify the code as needed to suit your specific requirements or to incorporate additional functionality.
